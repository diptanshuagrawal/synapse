"""derive/meetings/loop_dedup.py — shared whisper repetition-loop collapse.

Pins the two guards that keep a decoder loop out of the .txt, the merged .json,
and the events.db chunks: keep at most 2 consecutive identical lines, and cap
any identical line to 6 occurrences overall (alternating A/B loops). Semantics
mirror the awk collapses in bin/transcribe.sh — change both together.
